TO DO

- Address the remaining "---" issues

- Use the package system for look-up instead of the find-foo insanity.
- Get rid of any find-foo lookup at schema expansion/compilation time.

- Get "namespaces" (i.e., nested classes) fully working
[  - Printers need to print qualified names, as needed				]
[  - 'find-message-descriptor' and 'find-enum-descriptor' need to search        ]
[     namespaces if the quick compare against the name/class fails		]

- Lose 'proto-class', replace it with 'proto-type';
    its type is (or null symbol)
  'proto-type' should always be the name from the Lisp side
[  All 'define-xxx' macros should have, as their first argument,		]
[    a type (not a "name")							]
[  In .proto files, there should be an 'option lisp_name="pkg:name"'		]
[    which can be used to override the 'proto->class-name' default		]
[    for messages and enums							]

- Refactor 'field-descriptor' so the names are clearer:
  - Lose the existing 'proto-type' slot,
      then rename the 'proto-class' slot to 'proto-type';
      this will hold the Lisp name of the slot type
  - 'proto-name' will hold the Protobufs name of the field type
      (this used to hold the Protobufs name of the field)
[  - &key name should give the Protobufs name for the field			]
[  - 'option lisp_name="pkg:name"' should give the Lisp name for the slot	]

- Refactor 'define-message'/'define-extend'/'define-group'
  to avoid so much duplicated code

[- Need search paths in the ASDF .proto module					]

[- Make 'import' really work							]
[  - *all-protobufs* should record keyed by pathname, too			]
[  - 'import' should not bother loading if the import is present,		]
[    and should record the imported schema when it's done			]
[  - 'find-message-descriptor' and 'find-enum-descriptor' should search		]
[    imports, too                                                               ]

[- 'package'/'lisp_package' should create the package, if necessary.		]

[- Don't generate 'import "net/proto2/proto/descriptor.proto"' and		]
[  'extend proto2.MessageOptions { ..}' lines unless we need to include		]
[  one of the lisp_* options in the generated model				]

[- Handle 'import'								]
[  It should probably just compile/load the file when the import		]
[    is seen									]
[  - The Lisp macros should be able to import both .lisp and .proto files	]
[  - The .proto parser should only be able to import .proto files		]

[- Handle 'extension' and 'extends'						]
[  - 'define-extension' just declares the extension within a message		]
[      and adds it to 'proto-extensions' for the message			]
[  - Easiest is to add an "extension-p" flag to 'message-descriptor'		]
[  - Define new 'define-extends' macro						]
[      which *copies* all slots from the message being extended,		]
[      then just adds the extension fields as (flagged) ordinary fields		]
[      with reader/writer function (see below)					]
[      - Factor out field-processing code from 'define-message'			]
[      - If we do it this way, no other special magic is needed			]
[        Serialization, e.g., should just work					]
[        Scoping should also just work						]
[      - We will need 'proto-writer' as an analog to 'proto-reader'		]
[  - Get deserialization working;						]
[      Need to call the 'proto-writer' function if its around			]
[      instead of just using (setf (slot-value ...) ...)			]
[  - Don't forget to check that the "extends" indexes match			]
[      what was declared by 'define-extension'					]
[      - And don't allow overlapping extension indexes				]
[  - Generate new getter and setter methods for each extended slot:		]
[      (let ((an-int 10))							]
[       (declare (type (or integer null) an-int))				]
[       (defmethod an-int ((object extendable-foo))				]
[         an-int)								]
[       (defmethod (setf an-int) (val (object extendable-foo))			]
[         (declare (type (or integer null) val)					]
[         (setq an-int val))))							]
[  - Handle "extends" in the parser, too					]

[- Speed up 'list-of' by shadowing the Quux version,				]
[    and don't do any type-checking (!)						]
[  Having done this, we can probably remove the hack of using map:map,		]
[    which should make deserialization much faster				]

[- 'proto-name' should always be the name from the Protobufs side;		]
[    its type is (or null string)						]
[  All 'define-xxx' macros should have '&key name' which gives the Protobufs	]
[   name, which can be used to override the 'class-name->proto' default		]

[- 'deserialize-object' uses the alias when it calls 'make-instance',		]
[    or if there is no alias, 'proto-type'					]

[- 'serialize-object' and 'object-size' never use the alias;			]
[    instead all the "dispatching" should be done of off 'proto-type',		]
[  Ditto, 'print-text-format'							]

[- The "name" of a protobuf should be the camel-cased file name			]
[  The "type" of a protobuf should just be the file name as a keyword symbol	]

[- RPCs should have 'input-name', 'input-type', 'output-name' and 'output-type'	]
[  The "name" ones are for the Protobufs side					]
[  The "types" ones are for the Lisp side; we look up on "type" only		]
[  In the Lisp, the RPC types can be either 'type' or '(type :name <name>)'	]
[  In .proto files, there should be an 'option lisp_name="pkg:name"'		]
[   which can be used to override the 'proto->class-name' default		]
[   for the name of the RPC function						]

[- Finishing eliminating 'protobuf' argument from the API			]
[  - Lose it in 'serialize-object-to-stream' and 'deserialize-object-from-stream']
[  - Rename it to 'trace' in '(de)serialize-object' and 'object-size',		]
[      make it be the last supplied argument					]
[  - Fix up the '(de)serialize-object' and 'object-size' generators, too	]
[  - Apply the same fix to 'print-text-format'					]
[  - Then make the compatibility API actuallty work				]

[- Implement 'parse-text-format'						]

[- Write documentation								]
