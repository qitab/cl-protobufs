;;; This file provides a stream-like abstraction, a BUFFER, that Protobuf serialization
;;; logic can use to perform a one-pass traversal of the input object tree such that
;;; all variable-length pieces are properly length-prefixed but without having to
;;; precompute lengths. This differs from the C implementation of serialization,
;;; which (by default) requires a pre-pass to compute the lengths for all constituent
;;; variable-length pieces such as strings and sub-messages.

;; WITH-BUFFER-AS-STREAM binds STREAM to a character output stream that when written to
;; places ASCII characters into BUFFER. There are three cases, listed here
;; in order from most efficient to least efficient:
;; 1. (WITH-BUFFER-AS-STREAM (stream buffer :length n)
;;    Length specified as an integer N (evaluated at runtime) will encode a prefix of N
;;    then accept N characters. Writing anything other than exactly N will signal an eror.
;; 2. (WITH-BUFFER-AS-STREAM (stream buffer :length :TINY)
;;    Length specified as the literal symbol :TINY will leave a 1-byte gap for a prefix.
;;    (... :length N) where N runtime evaluates to the keyword :TINY is not legal.
;;    Between 0 and 127 characters may be written, and the prefix will be modified accordingly.
;;    An error will be signaled if more than 127 characters are written.
;; 3. (WITH-BUFFER-AS-STREAM (stream buffer) ...)
;;    No length specified will leave a 4-byte placeholder for an arbitrary length and
;;    backpatch it in. This relies on buffer compactification in the same way as does
;;    writing of an unknown-length submessage.

;; In all cases, non-ASCII characters are rejected.
;; If TAG is supplied, it is encoded prior to the encoding of the string data.
;; This macro should be used for effect, not value - its return value is undefined.
