;;; Protobuf serialization from Lisp objects

;;; When the optimize speed option is used we avoid using DEFMETHOD, which generates
;;; generic functions that are costly to lookup at runtime.  Instead, we define
;;; the "methods" as functions that are attached to the symbol naming the class,
;;; so we can easily locate them using GET at runtime.
;;; In SBCL, generalized function names are used instead.
