cl-protobufs is an implementation of
[Google protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) for
Common Lisp.

## Installation

1.  Install `protoc`

    Common Lisp code for a given `.proto` file is generated by a plug-in for
    `protoc`, the protocol buffer compiler. The plug-in is written in C++ and
    requires the full version of Google's protocol buffer code to be installed
    in order to build it, not just the precompiled protoc binaries.

    Download and build Google protobuf. Rough instructions are included here for
    Unix systems. If you have any problems please see the
    [protobuf installation instructions](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/src).

    ```shell
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/protobuf
    $ cd protobuf
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
    ```

    Make sure the `protoc` binary is on your `PATH`.

2.  Build the Lisp `protoc` plugin

    ```shell
    $ cd cl-protobufs/protoc
    $ PROTOC_ROOT=/usr/local make     # value of --prefix, above
    $ sudo cp protoc-gen-lisp /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    Make sure the installation directory is on your `PATH`.

## Generating the Lisp Code from Proto files

There are two ways of doing this, either using `protoc` or `ASDF`.

### Using `ASDF` to generate Lisp code.

If you add `:defsystem-depends-on (:cl-protobufs.asdf)` to your defsystem,
`ASDF` can generate Lisp code directly from your .proto files.  For each
`.proto` file add a component of type `:protobuf-source-file` with a
`:proto-pathname`.  You may also need to specify `:proto-search-path` to
help the `protoc` compiler find protos imported by your `.proto` file.
The pathnames can be relative with respect to the `pathname` of the system
you are building.

Several examples can be found in `cl-protobufs.asd`.

### Using `protoc` to Generate Lisp Code

To test your build, try generating Lisp code from the
`cl-protobufs/tests/case-preservation.proto` file with the following command.
Note that the command may differ slightly depending on what directory you're in
and where you installed `protoc-gen-lisp`. In this case we assume you're in the
directory **containing** the `cl-protobufs` directory. The reason will become
clear in a moment.

```shell
$ protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-lisp=/usr/local/bin/protoc-gen-lisp \
  --lisp_out=output-file=case-preservation.lisp:/tmp \
  cl-protobufs/tests/case-preservation.proto
```

This command should generate a file named `case-preservation.lisp` in the
`/tmp/` directory.

When a `.proto` file imports another `.proto` file, `protoc` needs to know how
to find the imported file. It does this by looking for the file relative to the
values passed to it with the `--proto_path` option (or the `-I` short option).

To see an example of this, you can try generating Lisp code for
`cl-protobufs/tests/extend.proto`. Still in the same directory, run the
following command:

```shell
protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-lisp=/usr/local/bin/protoc-gen-lisp \
  --lisp_out=output-file=extend.lisp:/tmp
  --proto_path=cl-protobufs/tests \
  cl-protobufs/tests/extend.proto
```

The file `/tmp/extend.lisp` should be generated. Note that the `.lisp` file for
each imported file also needs to be generated separately.

## ASDF

Build and run the tests with ASDF:

*   Install [Quicklisp](http://quicklisp.org) and make sure to add it to your
    Lisp implementation's init file.

*   Install ASDF if it isn't part of your Lisp implementation.

    

*   Create a link to cl-protobufs so that Quicklisp will use the local version:

    ```shell
    $ cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
    $ ln -s .../path/to/cl-protobufs
    ```

*   Start Lisp and evaluate `(ql:quickload :cl-protobufs)`.

*   Load and run the tests:

    ```lisp
    cl-user> (asdf:test-system :cl-protobufs)
    ```

## Examples

The files `example/math.lisp` and `example/math-test.lisp` give a simple example
of creating a proto structure, populating its fields, serializing, and then
deserializing. Looking over these files is a good way to get a quick feel for
the protobuf API, which is described in detail below.

The file `math.proto` has two messages: `AddNumbersRequest` and
`AddNumbersResponse`.



The prefix `cl-protobufs.` is automatically added to the package name specified
by `package math;`, resulting in `cl-protobufs.math` as the full package name
for the generated code. This is done to avoid conflicts with existing packages.

The full name of the Lisp type for the `AddNumbersRequest` message is
`cl-protobufs.math:add-numbers-request`.

## Generated Code Guide

This section explains the code generated from a `.proto` file by
`protoc-gen-lisp`, the Common Lisp plugin for `protoc`. See the "protoc"
directory in this distribution for the plugin code.

Note that `protoc-gen-lisp` transforms protobuf names like `MyMessage` or
`my_field` to names that are more Lisp-like, such as `my-message` and
`my-field`.

The code generated by `protoc-gen-lisp` uses macros to define the generated API.
Protocol buffer messages should be defined in `.proto` files instead of invoking
these macros directly. Internal details that are not in the API documented below
may change incompatibly in the future.

### Packages

The generated code for each `.proto` file lives in a package derived from the
`package` statement.

```protocol-buffer
package abc;
```

The generated Lisp package for the above is `cl-protobufs.abc`. The prefix
"cl-protobufs." is added in order to avoid conflicts with another Lisp package
named "abc". If you prefer to use a shorter package name we recommend using
`:local-nicknames` as we do in many files in this library. Example:

```lisp
(defpackage #:my.project
  (:use #:common-lisp)
  (:local-nicknames (#:abc #:cl-protobufs.abc)))  ; Referenced as abc:
```

You may have multiple `.proto` files use the same package if desired. The
package exports the symbols described in the sections below.

### Groups (proto2 only) {#Groups}

Groups are a deprecated way of defining a nested message and a field in a single
declaration:

```protocol-buffer
syntax = "proto2";
package abc;
message Foo {
  optional group Bar = 1 {
    optional string a = 1;
    optional int32 b = 2;
  }
}
```

This is treated exactly the same way as defining a nested message named `Bar`
and a field named `bar`:

```protocol-buffer
syntax = "proto2";
package abc;
message Foo {
  message Bar {
    optional string a = 1;
    optional int32 b = 2;
  }
  optional Bar bar = 1;
}
```

See the following sections for details on how to access nested messages and
fields from Lisp.

### Messages (proto2)

This section uses the following protocol buffer messages as an example:

```protocol-buffer
syntax = "proto2";

package abc;

message DateRange {
    optional string min_date = 1;
    optional string max_date = 2;
}
```

```lisp
(make-date-range :min-date "2020-05-27" :max-date "2020-05-28")
```

Construct a `date-range` message.

```lisp
(date-range.min-date range)
```

Get the value of the `min-date` field from the `range` message.

If the field was explicitly set, that value is returned. Otherwise, a default
value is returned: the default value specified for this field in the `.proto`
file, if any, or a type-specific default value. Type-specific default values are
as follows:

protobuf type   | default value
--------------- | -----------------------------------------
numerics        | zero of the appropriate type
strings         | the empty string
messages        | `nil`
groups          | `nil`
enums           | the first value listed in the .proto file
booleans        | `nil`
repeated fields | the empty list
symbols         | `nil`

Note that with nested messages and long message names, field accessor names can
get pretty long. If speed is not an issue it is also possible to access fields
via the `cl-protobufs:field` generic function.

```lisp
(cl-protobufs:field range 'min-date)
```

An alternative (slower, but often more concise) way to read a protobuf field's
value.

```lisp
(date-range.has-min-date range)
```

Check whether a field has been set. Returns `t` if the `min-date` field has been
set, otherwise `nil`.

```lisp
(date-range.clear-min-date range)
```

Clear the value of a field. After the above call `(date-range.has-min-date
range)` returns `nil` and `(date-range.min-date range)` returns the default
value.

### Messages (proto3)

This section uses the following protocol buffer message as an example:

```protocol-buffer
syntax = "proto3";

message Event {
  int32 day = 1;
  int32 month = 2;
  int32 year = 3;
  repeated string invitees = 4;
}
```

The generated code for proto3 messages is similar to proto2 messages. The only
difference is the introduction of fields with no specified label, which are
known as "singular" fields. For singular fields, the state of being unset and
the state of being set to the default value for the type are indistinguishable.
So, `has-*` functions, such as `(event.has-day msg)` are not defined.

The `has-*` functions for repeated fields are defined. They return true if and
only if the field has been manually set and has not been cleared since.

This library supports optional fields in proto3 messages. These fields have the
same semantics and generated code as proto2 optional fields.

### Maps

This section uses the following protocol buffer message as an example:

```protocol-buffer
message Dictionary {
  map<int32,string> map_field = 1;
}
```

This creates an associative map with keys of type `int32` and values of type
`string`. In general, the key type can be any scalar type except `float` and
`double`. The value type can be any protobuf type. For a message `dict` of type
`Dictionary`, the following functions are created to access the map:

```lisp
(dictionary.map-field-gethash 2 dict)
```

This returns the value associated with `2` in the `map-field` field in `dict`.
If there is no value explicitly set, this function returns the default value of
the value type. In this case, the empty string.

```lisp
(setf (dictionary.map-field-gethash 1 dict) "one")
```

This associates `1` with the value `"one"` in the `map-field` field in `dict`.

```lisp
(dictionary.map-field-remhash 1 dict)
```

This removes any entry with key `1` in the `map-field` field in `dict`.

Like the other fields, these functions are aliased by methods which are slower
but more concise. Examples of the methods are: `(map-field-gethash 2 dict)`,
`(setf (map-field-gethash 1 dict) "one")`, and `(map-field-remhash 1 dict)`.
These have the same functionality as the above 3 functions respectively.

These functions are type checked, and interfacing with the map with these
functions alone will guarantee that (de)serialization functions as well as the
`(dictionary.has-map-field dict)` function will work properly. The underlying
hash table may be accessed directly via `(dictionary.map-field dict)`, but doing
so may result in undefined behavior.

### Enums

```proto
enum DayOfWeek {
  DAY_UNDEFINED = 0;
  MON = 1;
  TUE = 2;
  WED = 3;
  ...
}
```

The above enum defines the Lisp type `day-of-week`, like this:

```lisp
(deftype day-of-week '(member :day-undefined :mon :tue :wed ...))
```

Each enum value is represented by a keyword symbol which is mapped to/from its
numeric equivalent during serialization and deserialization.

```lisp
(defun day-of-week-to-int (name) ...)
```

Convert a keyword symbol to its numeric value. Example: `(day-of-week-to-int
:mon) => 1`

```lisp
(defun int-to-day-of-week (num) ...)
```

Convert a number to its symbolic name. Example: `(int-to-day-of-week 1) => :MON`

```lisp
(defconstant +mon+ 1)
```

Each numeric enum value is also bound to a constant by the same name but with
"+" on each side.

Note that most enums should have an "undefined" or "unset" field with value `0`
so that message fields using this enum type have a reasonable default value that
is distinguishable from valid values. (It probably wouldn't make sense for
Monday to be the default day.)

Name conflicts with other enum constants can easily happen if they all have a
field named "undefined", so in this case we named the "undefined" field with a
`DAY_` prefix. For this reason it is also common to nest an enum inside the
message that uses it.

When an enum is defined inside of a message instead of at top level in the
`.proto` file, the message name is prepended to the name. For example, if
`DayOfWeek` had been defined inside of a `Schedule` message it would result in
these definitions:

```lisp
(deftype schedule.day-of-week '(member :day-undefined :mon :tue :wed ...))
(schedule.day-of-week-to-int :mon) => 1
(int-to-schedule.day-of-week 1) => :MON
(defconstant +schedule.day-undefined+ 0)  ; may not need the DAY_ prefix now.
(defconstant +schedule.mon+ 1)
...

```


#### Enum Backward Compatability

For backward compatibility, unrecognized enum values are retained during
deserialization and are output again when serialized. This allows a client
that acts as a pass-through for the enum data to function correctly even if
it uses a different version of the proto than the systems it is communicating with.

Message Schema V1
```protocol-buffer
enum DayOfWeek {
  DAY_UNDEFINED = 0;
  MON = 1;
  TUE = 2;
  WED = 3;
}
message DayIWillWork {
  optional DayOfWeek workday = 1;
}
```
Message Schema V2
```protocol-buffer
enum DayOfWeek {
  DAY_UNDEFINED = 0;
  MON = 1;
  TUE = 2;
  WED = 3;
  THUR = 4;
}
message DayIWillWork {
  optional DayOfWeek workday = 1;
}
```

If we send a V2 message:

```protocol-buffer
DayIWillWork {
  workday: THUR
}
```

to a V1 system it will save the fact that the enum it
received is 4. Calling `(day-i-will-work.workday v2-proto)`
will return `:%undefined-4`. Reserialization will add the
workday enum value to the serialized protobuf message, and
deserialization on a V2 system will properly add the
new `:thur` enum value to the new protocol beffer message.

Trying to call `(setf (day-i-will-work.workday v2-proto) :%undefined-4`
will signal an error on a V1 or V2 system since `:%undefined-4` isn't a
known enum value.

### Oneof

This section uses the following protobuf message as an example:

```protocol-buffer
message Person {
  optional string name = 1;
  oneof AgeOneof {
    int32 age = 2;
    string birthdate = 3;
  }
}
```

To access fields inside a oneof, use the standard accessors outlined above.
These fields have the semantics of proto2 optional fields, so `has-*` functions
are created. For example:

```lisp
(setf (person.age bob) 5)
```

will set the `age` field of a `Person` object `bob` to `5`. Defining a oneof
also creates two special functions:

```lisp
(person.age-oneof-case bob)
```

This will return the lisp symbol corresponding to the field which is currently
set. So, if we set `age` to `5`, then this will return the symbol `AGE`. If no
field is set, this function will return `nil`.

```lisp
(person.has-age bob)
```

returns true.

```lisp
(person.clear-age-oneof bob)
```

This will clear all fields inside of the oneof `age-oneof`.

### Repeated Fields

We use the following protocol buffer message as an example
in this section:

```protocol-buffer
message RepeatedProto {
  repeated integer my_int_list = 1;
  repeated integer my_int_vector = 1 [(lisp_container) = VECTOR];
}
```

This creates a message with two fields.
The field `my_int_list` stores a list of integers.
The default value is the empty list, i.e. `nil`.
The field `my_int_vector` stores a vector of integers.
The default value is an empty vector which is extendable with a fill pointer.

The APIs for the list and vector repeated fields are the same.
There is a minor difference when pushing onto the different types of repeated field.

```lisp
(repeated-proto.push-my-int-list 1 my-message)
```

This pushes the integer 1 onto the `my_int_list` field in the `RepeatedProto`.
Since we push onto a list this will push into the front of the list.

```lisp
(repeated-proto.push-my-int-vector 1 my-message)
```

This pushes the integer `1` onto the `my_int_vector` field in the `RepeatedProto`.
Since we push onto a vector this will push into the back of the vector.

```lisp
(repeated-proto.has-my-int-list my-message)
(repeated-proto.has-my-int-vector my-message)
```

The `has-*` functions on a repeated field return true if there
are no elements in the sequence.

```lisp
(repeated-proto.length-of-my-int-list my-message)
(repeated-proto.length-of-my-int-vector my-message)
```

The `length-of-*` function returns the number of elements in the repeated field.

```lisp
(repeated-proto.nth-my-int-list n my-message)
(repeated-proto.nth-my-int-vector n my-message)
```

This returns the element at position `n` in the repeated field.
If the repeated field has length less then `n` we signal an error.

```lisp
(repeated-proto.clear-my-int-list my-message)
(repeated-proto.clear-my-int-vector my-message)
```

This clears the repeated field of all elements.

### Symbols

A string field may be annotated as a symbol field, which will cause it to be
represented in Lisp as an interned symbol rather than a string. Example:

```lisp
import "third_party/lisp/cl_protobufs/proto2-descriptor-extensions.proto";

message Foo {
   optional symbol = 1 [(lisp_type) = "CL:SYMBOL"];
}
```

When converting from text mode, we uppercase the string, and if it does not
contain a colon we intern it as a keyword symbol, except that we special case
"T" and "NIL" to refer to the corresponding Lisp symbols. If the string contains
a colon at the beginning, then we also intern it as a keyword symbol, but if it
contains a colon elsewhere in the string, the portion preceding the colon is
interpreted a package name. Thus, the following lines are equivalent

```
symbol: "foo"
symbol: "FOO"
symbol: "keyword:foo"
```

as are

```
symbol: "t"
symbol: "common-lisp:t"
```

but note that these are different:

```
symbol: "t"
symbol: ":t"
```

Multiple colons are not allowed, nor are the single-quote, double-quote, and
backslash characters.


### Options

TODO

### Services

This section describes the geenrated code API for a protobuf service in a proto file.
You must have a corresponding RPC library as well; `cl-protobufs` just generates the
methods.

The [gRPC](https://github.com/qitab/grpc) library, or any library containing the following
form:

```lisp
(setq cl-protobufs:*rpc-call-function* 'start-call)
```

can be used as the underlying RPC mechanism. We will show examples with the expectation
that you are using gRPC.

The following example service definition is used throughout this section.

```protobuf
lisp_package = "math";

message AddNumbersRequest {
  optional int32 number1 = 1;
  optional int32 number2 = 1;
}

message AddNumbersResponse {
  optional int32 sum = 1;
}

Service MyService
  rpc AddNumbers(AddNumbersRequest) returns (AddNumbersResponse) {}
}
```

The `cl-protobufs` `protoc` plugin generates two packages:

* `cl-protobufs.math`
* `cl-protobufs.math-rpc`

The package `cl-protobufs.math` contains the `add-numbers-request` and `add-numbers-response`
protocol buffer messages.

#### Client

The package `cl-protobufs.math-rpc` contains a stub for `call-add-numbers`. A message can be
sent to a server implementing the `Greeter` service with:

```lisp
  (grpc:with-insecure-channel
      (channel (concatenate 'string hostname ":" (write-to-string port-number)))
    (let* ((request (cl-protobufs.testing:make-add-numbers-request
                     :number-1 1 :number-2 2))
           (response (cl-protobufs.math-rpc:call-add-numbers channel request)))
      ...))
```

#### Server

There is currently no known supported open framework for implementating
the server portion of Protocol Buffer services in Lisp.



```lisp
(defgeneric add-numbers-impl (channel (request add-numbers-request) rpc))
```

A generic function generated for each RPC in the service definition. The name is
the concatenation of the protobuf method name (in its Lisp form) and the string
"-impl".

To implement the service define a method for each generic function. The method
must return the type declared in the `.proto` file. Example:

```lisp
(defmethod add-numbers-impl (channel (request add-numbers-request) rpc)
  (make-add-numbers-response :sum (+ (add-numbers-request.number1 request)
                                     (add-numbers-request.number2 request))))
```

The `channel` argument is supplied by the underlying RPC code and differs
depending on which transport mechanism (HTTP, TCP, IPC, etc) is being used. The
`channel` and `rpc` arguments can usually be ignored.

## The cl-protobufs Package

This section documents the symbols exported from the `cl-protobufs` package.

```lisp
(defstruct message ...)
```

The base type from which every generated protobuf message inherits.

```lisp
(defun print-text-format (object &key
                                 (indent -2)
                                 (stream *standard-output*)
                                 (pretty-print-p t)))
```

Prints a protocol buffer message to a stream. `object` is the protocol buffer
message, group, or extension to print. `stream` is the stream to print to.
`pretty-print-p` may be set to `nil` to minimize textual output by omitting
most whitespace.

```lisp
(defun parse-text-format (type &key (stream *standard-input*)))
```

Parses a protocol buffer message written in text-format.
`type` is the type of message to parse. `stream` is the stream to read from.

```lisp
(defun is-initialized (object))
```

Check if `object` has all required fields set, and recursively all of its
sub-objects have all of their required fields set. An error may be signaled if
an attempt is made to serialize a protobuf object that is not initialized.
Signals an error if `object` is not a protobuf message.

```lisp
(defun proto-equal (message-1 message-2 &key exact nil))
```

Check if two protobuf messages are equal. By default, two messages are equal if
calling the getter on each field would retrieve the same value. This means that
a message with a field explicitly set to the default value is considered equal
to a message with that field not set.

If `exact` is true, consider the messages to be equal only if the same fields
have been explicitly set.

`message-1` and `message-2` must both be protobuf messages.

```lisp
(defgeneric clear (object message))
```

Resets the protobuf message to its initial state.

```lisp
(defun has-field (object field))
```

Returns whether `field` has been explicitly set in `object`. `field` is the
symbol naming the field in the proto message.

### Serialization

```lisp
(deftype byte-vector)
```

A vector of unsigned-bytes. In serialization functions this is often referred to
as buffer.

```lisp
(defun make-byte-vector (size &key adjustable))
```

Constructor to make a byte vector. `size` is the size of the underlying vector.
`adjustable` is a boolean value determining whether the byte-vector can change
size.

```lisp
(defun serialize-to-bytes (object &optional (type (type-of object))))
```

Creates a byte-vector and serializes a protobuf message to that byte-vector. The
`object` is the protobuf message instance to serialize. Optionally use `type` to
specify the type of object to serialize.

```lisp
(defun serialize-to-stream (object stream &optional (type (type-of object)))
```

Serialize `object`, a protobuf message, to `stream`. Optionally use `type` to
specify the type of object to serialize.

```lisp
(defun deserialize-from-bytes (type buffer &optional (start 0) (end (length buffer))))
```

Deserialize a protobuf message returning the newly created structure. `type` is
the symbol naming the protobuf message to deserialize. `buffer` is the
byte-vector containing the data to deserialize. `start` (inclusive) and `end`
(exclusive) delimit the range of bytes to deserialize.

```lisp
(defun deserialize-from-stream (type stream)
```

Deserialize an object of type `type` by reading bytes from `stream`. `type` is
the symbol naming the protobuf message to deserialize.


## Well Known Types

Several functions are exported from the `cl-protobufs.well-known-types` package.
A list of all well known types can be found in the
[official Protocol Buffers documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf).

```lisp
(defun unpack-any (any-message))
```

Takes an `Any` protobuf message `any-message` and turns it into the stored
protobuf message as long as the qualified-name given in the type-url corresponds
to a loaded message type. The type-url must be of the form
base-url/qualified-name.

```lisp
(defun pack-any (message &key (base-url "type.googleapis.com"))
```

Creates an `Any` protobuf message given a protobuf `message` and a `base-url`.

## JSON Mapping

The `cl-protobufs.json` package exports functions to convert between protobuf
objects and
[the canonical JSON encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).

```lisp
(defun print-json (message &key (pretty-print-p t) (stream *standard-output*)
                             (camel-case-p t) numeric-enums-p))
```

Takes any protobuf message `message` and prints it as JSON. The parameters are:

-   `pretty-print-p`: Indent the output by `indent` spaces and print newlines.
-   `stream`: The Lisp stream to output to.
-   `camel-case-p`: Print field names in camelCase. If `nil`, then print field
    names as they appear in the .proto file.
-   `numeric-enums-p`: If true, print enum values by their number rather than
    their name.

```lisp
(defun parse-json (type &key stream ignore-unknown-fields-p)
```

Parse a JSON encoding and return the parsed protobuf object. The parmeters are:

-   `type`: Either the Lisp type or the `message-descriptor` of the object to
    parse.
-   `stream`: The stream to read from. By default, this is \*standard-input\*.
-   `ignore-unknown-fields-p`: If true, silently ignore any unrecognized fields
    encountered when parsing. If `nil`, the parser will throw an error.


## Known Deficiencies

This is a non-exhaustive list of ways in which cl-protobufs doesn't currently
meet the Protocol Buffers spec.

*   Groups are not supported within `oneof` fields.
*   The `[deprecated=true]` field option is not supported.
